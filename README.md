## Always Active Window

This extension protects against web pages tracking the activity state of the page. Some websites use this track to only offer services when the tab is active. By installing this extension a small script is injected into every webpage which overwrites the "document.visibilityState", and "document.hidden" properties to pretend the tab is always in the active state (document.visibilityState = 'visible' and document.hidden = false).
